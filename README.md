# Detection of obstacle using IR obstacle avoidance sensor
The goal of this project is to design and develop an obstacle detection system using an infrared (IR) obstacle avoidance 
sensor and Arduino microcontroller, with the integration of IoT principles. The system will provide a reliable and 
efficient solution for detecting and avoiding obstacles in autonomous systems, such as robotic devices or automated 
vehicles.
